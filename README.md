# Microbit-Animations
Create your own images and then animate them. Class session of about 1 1/2 hours.

The files are in order of the class session.

Pair the children off, or in a three if not possible. No lone coders. Ask them why are they in pairs. 
Normal response is that there are not enough computers. True but not why. Two brains are smarter than one.
A team will stay more productive if one is flagging. They will learn off each other and all should come out
at the end at the same level.

Have one at the keyboard as the driver. The other is the navigator instructing the driver what to type. If the driver
has an idea, such as a change of image, then they can pass the keyboard over. Code must go through someone elses fingers
to get in the computer.

Point out the need for exact copying of the text. 9/10 doesn't cut it in the world of coding. Spelling, spaces and punctuation.
The English teacher tells them to write in sentences and paragraphs. Code is the same. It makes it easier to read as a human.
Quicker to find errors. But the computer really doesn't mind.

Start with the basic Microbit Hello world of the smiley face.

Some children will get it quicker than others. Ask those what is the opposite to happy.
Get them to try sad instead. Some may not realise the need for the capital letters.
